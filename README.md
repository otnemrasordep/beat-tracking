# beatTracking
First Assignment for ECS7006P: Music Informatics.

Implementation and testing of a beat tracking system for ballroom dance music. 
Specifically, we are asked to develop a procedure that returns the tactus (or primary metrical level) and also 
the downbeat (the beat at the beginning of each measure), of a given audio excerpt. 
To this extent, we implemented and built upon the solution proposed by Ellis which utilizes dynamic programming 
for the problem of beat tracking. Furthermore, this implementation was supported by the guidelines presented in the 
moduleâ€™s textbook.
